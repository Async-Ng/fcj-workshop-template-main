Market analysis emphasizes this trend, with the global military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market projected to expand at an estimated compound annual growth rate of 11.2% through 2033.\nThe significant growth of military UAVs—which are viewed as representative of the broader autonomous systems market—highlights the urgent need for scalable, secure, and efficient software deployment solutions. As the number of autonomous platforms increases, so does the complexity in managing their software. In response to these challenges, Shield AI and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have collaborated and successfully demonstrated a scalable architecture and proof of concept (PoC) to address the common issues encountered when deploying autonomous software and machine learning algorithms to autonomous systems. By integrating Shield AI\u0026rsquo;s platform-agnostic autonomous software development suite, Hivemind Enterprise, with AWS IoT Core and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), autonomous system developers can develop a Hivemind Pilot and—after simulation and testing are complete—deploy it directly to the hardware platform of their choice from the AWS cloud using command line interface (CLI) or Hivemind\u0026rsquo;s user interface.\nChallenges in Autonomous System Deployment For defense customers deploying autonomous systems, software deployment encounters numerous challenges, including:\nScaling across multiple vehicle types: Supporting air, ground, and maritime autonomous vehicles Mission-specific collaboration: Increasing demand for coordination between vehicles Rapid deployment in DDIL environments: The necessity to rapidly deploy updates across large fleets of vehicles in denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments Emerging conflicts demand rapid software updates and reconfiguration across different system software components. From integrated control firmware, mission machine learning models, to \u0026ldquo;AI pilots,\u0026rdquo; these updates must be deployed securely and reliably to vehicle formations, ensuring system integrity to counter evolving threats and mission requirements. While many aspects of autonomous vehicle systems such as advanced hardware, sensors, navigation, and autonomous perception have made rapid progress, updating these systems often requires time-consuming manual processes that can slow initial development and testing of new capabilities, create bottlenecks during mission execution, and create opportunities for misconfiguration.\nLiz Martin, DoD General Manager at AWS, emphasized the importance of this collaboration:\n\u0026ldquo;Our defense customers need rapid autonomous software updates to maintain readiness and respond to emerging mission requirements. Through the collaboration between Shield AI and AWS, we have a solution that delivers development and deployment of mission autonomy capabilities at formation scale across autonomous platforms.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Solution The collaboration addressed the challenge of updating autonomous systems by building a flexible solution that uses AWS IoT Core as a scalable and secure mechanism to orchestrate updates and state between Shield AI\u0026rsquo;s software stacks (Edgeos) running on autonomous hardware platforms and Shield AI\u0026rsquo;s autonomous development platform. Because Hivemind pilots are deployed as containers, once a new deployment is ready and communicated via AWS IoT Core to the autonomous platform, the container is securely fetched from Amazon ECR where it is hosted by Hivemind as part of the development and deployment integration, creating a cloud-hosted approach.\nIn summary, the solution enables:\nCentralized control and rapid deployment of Hivemind pilot software Secure, cloud-based distribution to field systems Scalable management of large autonomous fleets Real-time monitoring and control of deployment processes Nathan Michael, Chief Technology Officer at Shield AI, stated:\n\u0026ldquo;Developing autonomy is both complex and expensive—but with AWS, we\u0026rsquo;re making it faster, easier, and more scalable. This collaboration combines Hivemind Enterprise autonomy systems and AWS infrastructure to streamline how customers develop, deliver, and maintain intelligent autonomous systems across large distributed fleets.\u0026rdquo;\nBenefits for Defense and Commercial Customers The collaboration brings advantages to both defense and commercial customers. Defense customers can now maintain high levels of mission readiness by rapidly updating their autonomous fleets to counter emerging threats and adapt to changing mission parameters. This capability comes with increased operational flexibility, allowing teams to quickly modify autonomous capabilities for new environments and mission types. The solution also enhances security measures by ensuring all platforms consistently run secure, up-to-date software versions, while providing centralized management and monitoring capabilities for autonomous platforms.\nCommercial Applications In the commercial realm, benefits extend across multiple industries:\nAgriculture: Operations can now efficiently update self-driving tractor fleets to adapt to seasonal changes and implement new farming techniques Oil \u0026amp; Gas: The industry can deploy critical updates to offshore autonomous systems, enhancing both safety protocols and operational efficiency Logistics and Warehousing: Businesses can seamlessly modify their autonomous vehicle fleets to adapt to evolving inventory requirements and routing needs Mining: Operations benefit from the ability to quickly update autonomous equipment to accommodate new terrain conditions or extraction methods Conclusion The collaboration between Shield AI and AWS addresses a critical challenge in autonomous system management. By demonstrating rapid, secure deployment of mission autonomy software, we are enabling organizations in both defense and commercial sectors to maximize the power of their autonomous fleets. This integration also establishes a foundation for post-mission data collection, which is crucial for driving rapid pilot development and continuous improvement of autonomous capabilities. In the next phase of collaboration, we are moving from proof of concept to production, and we are excited to explore how this solution will transform operations and unlock new possibilities in autonomy.\nAbout the Authors Keith Johnson Keith is the Chief Technologist for AWS\u0026rsquo;s United States Department of Defense (DoD) business.

From the largest cybersecurity attack of 2024 on Change Healthcare to widespread provider-payer disruptions affecting healthcare access, the pressure to transform is significant. Emerging technologies, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, offer pathways to revolutionize patient care while improving operational efficiency and security frameworks.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) and third-party solutions from AWS Marketplace equip HCOs with tools that enhance data security, accelerate AI adoption, streamline workflows, and improve patient outcomes.\nRecently, I moderated a panel discussion on Enabling Digital Transformation to Advance Healthcare, exploring how organizations navigate uncertainty while embracing new technologies. Our conversation focused on research from Forrester\u0026rsquo;s latest survey of 441 U.S. healthcare provider organizations, examining cloud infrastructure strategies, generative AI adoption, security, and compliance.\nThe panel included industry experts with deep healthcare technology experience:\nShannon Germain Farraher, Senior Analyst, Forrester Demetri Giannikopoulos, Chief Transformation Officer, Aidoc Dr. Dan Rafter, Senior Vice President of Partnerships and Product Strategy, Flywheel Wilson To, Vice President of Strategy, Philips In this post, I highlight key insights from our discussion on healthcare\u0026rsquo;s digital transformation journey.\nForrester Research Reveals Key Findings Forrester\u0026rsquo;s research identified four critical areas where HCOs are focusing their digital transformation efforts.\nFinding One: Security Takes Center Stage 92% of respondents identified improving enterprise security and reducing risk as their top priority. Farraher explained: \u0026ldquo;Healthcare is the most vulnerable industry according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2023. For hackers, it\u0026rsquo;s low-hanging fruit because there are so many unprotected entry points.\u0026rdquo;\nFinding Two: Data and Analytics Support AI Initiatives Adoption of advanced data and analytics enables AI initiatives, although 44% consider security concerns as their top infrastructure challenge. As one respondent emphasized, \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a good data infrastructure, then any fancy generative AI tool on top is no good.\u0026rdquo;\nFinding Three: Workforce Experience Drives Investment Decisions 90% of organizations plan to invest 10% or more in their technology infrastructure this year. According to Forrester, 83% expect improved revenue, while 79% predict improved workforce experience and engagement.\nFinding Four: Generative AI Adoption Shows Practical Patterns 20% of organizations operate at the scaling or enterprise stage with generative AI, but this number is expected to reach 90% within three years. Top use cases include workflow optimization (56%) and data integration, analytics, and personalized care treatment (approximately 50% each).\nCritical Differentiating Factors Accelerating Healthcare Transformation Unlike previous healthcare innovation cycles, converging factors create new opportunities for change. The regulatory landscape is evolving to enable technological progress, with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) now mentioned multiple times in recent legal updates. The pandemic demonstrated healthcare\u0026rsquo;s ability to innovate rapidly when facing threats.\n\u0026ldquo;What the industry has seen in the pandemic is the opportunity to innovate its way out of various crises,\u0026rdquo; observed Farraher. This creates a cultural shift toward embracing scalable technologies and faster implementation cycles.\nMost importantly, there is organic demand for organizational integration of generative AI. \u0026ldquo;Generative AI is in people\u0026rsquo;s hands every day so easily,\u0026rdquo; Farraher noted. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm, it becomes mainstream.\u0026rdquo; This \u0026ldquo;Bring Your Own AI\u0026rdquo; phenomenon contrasts with previous technology deployments like electronic health records that required extensive training.\nStrategic AI Deployment Approaches HCOs adopt approaches that balance enthusiasm with realistic timelines and safety requirements. The discussion focused on how organizations concentrate on automation, augmentation, and agility when implementing AI to enhance clinical capabilities, eliminate invisible work, and enable deeper insights. \u0026ldquo;There are a lot of minutes that can be saved, where customers want to see how we can deploy technology on behalf of their clinicians,\u0026rdquo; noted To.\nThe focus remains on enhancing rather than replacing human capabilities. Giannikopoulos emphasized strategic starting points for success: \u0026ldquo;Finding those initial use cases to explore, considering lessons from others, not trying to do this alone, and developing a comprehensive end-to-end process\u0026hellip; ultimately really matters.\u0026rdquo;\nOrganizations must recognize that AI deployment includes change management and cultural adaptation, not merely technology implementation. The goal is to build governance guidelines that direct enthusiasm for AI toward safe solutions.\nOvercoming Data and Infrastructure Barriers Data standardization is a major obstacle to AI deployment. Organizations often spend 85% of their time searching, de-identifying, and centralizing data before beginning analysis. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a very manual process one hundred percent without the right tools,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Rafter noted.\nThe industry is shifting from departmental solutions to enterprise-wide solutions, enabling comprehensive data integration. Giannikopoulos remarked: \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s now a strong drive toward collaboration, breaking down silos, enhancing interoperability between systems and people.\u0026rdquo; This facilitates precision medicine capabilities, which require seamless integration between genetic testing, medical imaging, and electronic health records.\nCloud infrastructure adoption has reached an inflection point where migration is no longer optional. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s no longer a question of whether we need to centralize data in a way that\u0026rsquo;s accessible outside the four walls of the hospital - that has to happen,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Rafter emphasized.\nSecurity and Compliance Strategies Healthcare organizations adopt a shared responsibility model, allocating security obligations among internal teams, cloud service providers, and solution providers. To emphasized: \u0026ldquo;Security is priority zero, privacy is priority zero, and patient safety is always at the center of everything.\u0026rdquo;\nOrganizations benefit from leveraging pre-established standard frameworks and certifications rather than building security capabilities from scratch. Giannikopoulos explained: \u0026ldquo;Safety by design is integrated into all our solutions. Adhering to those principles, while aligning with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, SOC 2 Type II\u0026hellip; gives you the opportunity to develop safe and robust solutions.\u0026rdquo;\nHealthcare leaders must clearly understand security partnership relationships and provider responsibilities to avoid knowledge gaps; therefore, training, transparency, and clearly documented agreements are key factors for successful cloud computing adoption.\nKey Recommendations for Navigating Digital Transformation Forrester\u0026rsquo;s research identified four strategic recommendations for healthcare organizations (HCOs) on their digital transformation journey.\nFirst: Advocate for Unified AI Regulatory Framework Adopt best practices through frameworks like the Coalition for Health Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) to validate AI tools for fairness, safety, and effectiveness.\nSecond: Leverage Bring Your Own AI (B-Y-O-A-I) Enthusiasm Rather than punishing employees, harness their interest. Over 20% of physicians and clinicians now use AI in their work. Farraher explained: \u0026ldquo;Leaders should start gathering and directing employee interest in B-Y-O-A-I tools, then transition them to approved and safer tools.\u0026rdquo;\nThird: Rely on Core Organizational Values During Uncertainty HCOs need to continue focusing on mission engagement, recognition programs, and employee autonomy. Farraher emphasized: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t pause initiatives like recognition. People often think it should be the first thing cut, but it should actually be the last.\u0026rdquo;\nFourth: Seek Provider Partners Aligned with Core Values Look for partners that demonstrate flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and minimal disruption. Farraher advised: \u0026ldquo;Challenge your partners, push them to meet your needs right now. At the same time, carefully evaluate how they will support you in taking the next step tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;\nConclusion The healthcare industry is at a transformative turning point, where the question has shifted from whether to adopt AI and cloud computing technologies to how to deploy them safely at scale. Forrester\u0026rsquo;s research and our expert panel show that successful transformation requires a balanced approach prioritizing security, employee experience, and strategic partnerships. Patient safety remains the core principle in all operations. To reminded the audience: \u0026ldquo;Behind every pixel, behind every bit and byte, is a patient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe coming years will separate thriving organizations from those merely surviving. The difference will be each organization\u0026rsquo;s ability to integrate advanced technologies while maintaining core missions focused on patient care. Organizations embracing this transformation with the right partners will deliver improved patient outcomes while enhancing operational efficiency.\nAbout AWS Marketplace AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog with numerous healthcare solutions across multiple categories and regions.

Executive Summary The FindNest platform leverages AI understanding and AWS Serverless architecture to transform accommodation search into a contextual, intelligent experience. By combining Amazon Bedrock for natural language processing and Amazon Location Service for spatial analysis, it enables users to find rooms using natural queries like \u0026ldquo;affordable room near Thu Duc with gym and safe area.\u0026rdquo;\nThe system (Frontend: React hosted on Amplify, Backend: AWS Lambda + API Gateway) stores data in DynamoDB, handles authentication via Cognito, and enriches listings with contextual insights such as food density, nearby amenities, and safety index. Notifications and OTP authentication are handled via Amazon SNS. The entire platform operates under AWS Free Tier with an estimated cost of ~$0.5/month.\n2. Problem Statement What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Current platforms only support simple filters such as price or area and lack the ability to understand nuanced user intent. Users must manually review hundreds of listings without AI assistance or location intelligence. There’s no mechanism to understand complex preferences like “safe neighborhood with good food options” or “easy commute to District 1.”\nThe Solution An AI-enhanced, serverless platform that interprets user intent through natural language, automatically enriches listings with contextual data (restaurants, safety, routes), and recommends relevant results using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Location Service. The backend filters listings stored in DynamoDB and ranks results using AI scoring.\nBenefits and Return on Investment AI Semantic Search: Bedrock interprets user intent beyond filters. Contextual Recommendations: Listings enriched by Location Service provide real-world relevance. Serverless Scalability: Fully managed services scale automatically with zero maintenance. Cost Efficiency: All components run within AWS Free Tier for MVP phase (~$0.5/month). 3.

We\u0026rsquo;re constantly thinking about new ways to help technical communities grow, and creating spaces like the AWS Developer Center and community.aws, where people can connect and share their knowledge and experiences.\nToday, we announce AWS Builder Center, a new home for builders to access all related resources, participate in the AWS community, and contribute feedback or product suggestions to AWS product teams. This new experience also integrates the previous AWS Developer Center and community.aws.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a range of exciting features, so let\u0026rsquo;s explore some of them.\nYour Voice Matters: Introducing Wishlist In my opinion, one of the most exciting new features is the Wishlist. Now you can submit your wishes for new features or improvements you\u0026rsquo;d like to see in AWS services. Others can also discover and vote for these wishes, while creating their own Wishlists.\nYou can impact the product roadmap alongside the community and help us shape the future of AWS services. You can share ideas, suggestions, feature requests, or challenges encountered when operating AWS services, with the ability for the AWS community to vote on ideas and highlight the most anticipated improvements. Our internal teams will monitor these and bring the most popular wishes to service teams, making your voice an integral part of the product development process.\nConnecting People in the AWS Community On the Connect page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find numerous opportunities to connect directly with AWS Heroes and AWS Community Builders. You can also discover and join AWS User Groups and AWS Cloud Clubs in cities near you around the world.\nNot only that, you can bookmark this page as a central hub to find upcoming community events, making it easy for you to discover learning and networking opportunities in your area, as well as meet like-minded builders with similar interests.\nSpeaking of following people, AWS Builder Center makes it easy to connect and interact with others, serving as the main hub of the AWS technical community. It brings together all the different ways you can connect with other builders. For example, the Who to Follow section will introduce you to AWS Heroes, Community Builders, and active community members sharing knowledge and expertise in areas you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nDiscover Our Hands-On AWS Resources On the Build page, you\u0026rsquo;ll discover ways to get familiar with AWS through hands-on experiences, such as interactive learning resources designed for all skill levels, like AWS Tutorials and AWS Workshops. You can also explore playgrounds for generative AI and agentic AI services, and find the AWS Free Tier to try AWS services for free within specified limits for each service.\nSelect the Toolbox page and discover the latest tools, programming language resources, as well as Open Source projects for AWS. Toolbox has everything you need to bootstrap your project and put it into operation.\nTo improve the building experience for builders, we plan to expand Builder Center\u0026rsquo;s built-in features, such as creating specialized groups and forums to collaborate on specific topics, organizing workshops for hands-on labs, and building various service playgrounds where builders can freely experiment with AWS services.\nSupporting Your Builder Journey The new Learn section serves as a gateway to skill development, bringing together everything you need to expand your AWS expertise. Here, you can discover learning and training resources, workshops, gamified experiences, and much more content to make your journey building on AWS both educational and engaging.\nSelect the Topics page, where you can explore and discover more content. You can explore content by topic and tags. There are also featured and trending topics sections, helping you stay on top of what\u0026rsquo;s currently attracting community interest.\nNative Localization for Your Spoken Language AWS Builder Center breaks down language barriers with comprehensive localization support. All content published in Builder Center is automatically available in 16 languages, and user-generated content, such as posts, comments, or wishes, can be machine-translated on demand using AWS Translate service. Thanks to this, you can collaborate with builders around the world, sharing knowledge and experiences across all language boundaries.\nBy default, all content will be displayed based on the language your browser is set to. However, you can change this setting by accessing the Settings page and selecting the language you want AWS Builder Center to use by default.\nRegister and Build Your Profile Now AWS Builder Center gives you a more personalized and comprehensive way to showcase your AWS journey. Your unique profile comes with a custom URL and shareable QR code, making it easy to connect with others and share your presence in the AWS community.\nAll your posts, wishes, and meaningful interactions are organized in a centralized interface, making them easy to track. On the Manage profile page, you can customize your profile, add specific interests and areas of expertise, helping you connect with builders who share your passion. Profile management happens seamlessly: it\u0026rsquo;s synchronized across all AWS services through AWS Builder ID, ensuring your identity is always consistent wherever you engage with AWS services.\nVisit builder.aws.com, register with AWS Builder ID, and choose your unique alias to access all features, including content creation, Wishlist, and community interaction tools.\nAWS Builder Center is designed to help you connect, learn, and build with other AWS builders, so enjoy your journey together!\nAbout the Authors Channy Yun (윤석찬) Channy is a Principal Developer Advocate for AWS Cloud.

Identify common network attack vectors (Ingress, Egress, and Inside attacks). Learn how to implement multilayer security using AWS services like WAF, Shield, Network Firewall, and Security Groups. Design \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; traffic flows using Transit Gateways and centralized egress points. Speakers Key Highlights Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Evolution TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password): Relies on a shared secret and requires manually typing a 6-digit code. It is free and offers flexible backups. FIDO2: Utilizes public-key cryptography and requires a simple touch or biometric scan. It supports variable authenticators and enforces strict backups. Understanding Attack Vectors Ingress Attacks: Threats entering from the internet, such as DDoS attacks, Application attacks (SQL injection, XSS), and Bot activities. Inside Attacks: Threats within the network, including lateral movement between services and malware spread. Egress Attacks: Threats attempting to leave the network, such as DNS tunneling or data exfiltration. Defense in Depth (Multilayer Security) Edge Protection: Use CloudFront, WAF, and Shield for DDoS prevention, application firewalls, bot control, and fraud detection. Network \u0026amp; Resource Control: Implement Security Groups \u0026amp; NACLs for resource-level and network-level control against lateral movement. East-West Traffic: Use Network Firewalls (IPS/IDS) to control traffic flow between VPCs. DNS Security: Implement Route 53 DNS Firewall for domain filtering and blocking malicious site access. Architecture \u0026amp; Traffic Flow Traffic Routing: Utilizing Transit Gateway with routing segments to manage complex connections between Production and Project VPCs. Centralized Egress: establishing a \u0026ldquo;Central Internet Egress\u0026rdquo; VPC to filter and monitor all outbound traffic via a Web Proxy or Firewall. Segmentation: Separating environments (e.g., Prod, Project A, Project B) into distinct subnets (Web/App, DB) to contain potential breaches. Key Takeaways Security Strategy Layered Defense: Security must be applied at multiple layers—Edge, Network, and Host—to effectively mitigate different types of attack vectors. Identity First: Move towards stronger authentication methods like FIDO2 for better security and user experience compared to traditional TOTP. Architectural Best Practices Centralization: Use Transit Gateways to centralize routing and simplify network management across multiple VPCs. Visibility: Implementing specific controls like DNS Firewalls and Network Firewalls provides visibility into internal (East-West) and outbound traffic, not just incoming requests. Applying to Work Review MFA Policy: Evaluate the feasibility of moving from TOTP to FIDO2 hardware keys or biometrics for privileged accounts. Audit Security Groups: Review current Security Groups and NACLs to ensure they are strictly defined to prevent lateral movement. Implement WAF: Deploy AWS WAF on public-facing Application Load Balancers (ALB) or API Gateways to block common web exploits. Network Segmentation: Assess the current VPC architecture and consider implementing a Transit Gateway if managing multiple VPCs to ensure \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; traffic flow. Event Experience Attending the “AWS Network Security \u0026amp; Architecture” workshop provided a clear visual guide to securing cloud infrastructure. Key experiences included:\nVisualizing Security Layers The diagrams clearly illustrated how different AWS services (WAF, Shield, Network Firewall) map to specific attack vectors like DDoS or SQL injection. It was valuable to see the distinction between guarding against \u0026ldquo;Ingress\u0026rdquo; attacks versus \u0026ldquo;Inside\u0026rdquo; lateral movements. Understanding Modern Auth The direct comparison between TOTP and FIDO2 highlighted the trade-offs between convenience (touch/biometric) and traditional methods (typing codes). Architecture Deep Dive Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Good Traffic Flows\u0026rdquo; diagram helped clarify how to architect a production-grade network using Transit Gateways and centralized internet egress points.

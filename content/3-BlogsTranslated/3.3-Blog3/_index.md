## Introduction

We truly value builders at AWS. We're constantly thinking about new ways to help technical communities grow, and creating spaces like the AWS Developer Center and community.aws, where people can connect and share their knowledge and experiences.

Today, we announce **AWS Builder Center**, a new home for builders to access all related resources, participate in the AWS community, and contribute feedback or product suggestions to AWS product teams. This new experience also integrates the previous AWS Developer Center and community.aws.

There's a range of exciting features, so let's explore some of them.

## Your Voice Matters: Introducing Wishlist

In my opinion, one of the most exciting new features is the **Wishlist**. Now you can submit your wishes for new features or improvements you'd like to see in AWS services. Others can also discover and vote for these wishes, while creating their own Wishlists.

You can impact the product roadmap alongside the community and help us shape the future of AWS services. You can share ideas, suggestions, feature requests, or challenges encountered when operating AWS services, with the ability for the AWS community to vote on ideas and highlight the most anticipated improvements. Our internal teams will monitor these and bring the most popular wishes to service teams, making your voice an integral part of the product development process.

## Connecting People in the AWS Community

On the **Connect** page, you'll find numerous opportunities to connect directly with AWS Heroes and AWS Community Builders. You can also discover and join AWS User Groups and AWS Cloud Clubs in cities near you around the world.

Not only that, you can bookmark this page as a central hub to find upcoming community events, making it easy for you to discover learning and networking opportunities in your area, as well as meet like-minded builders with similar interests.

Speaking of following people, AWS Builder Center makes it easy to connect and interact with others, serving as the main hub of the AWS technical community. It brings together all the different ways you can connect with other builders. For example, the **Who to Follow** section will introduce you to AWS Heroes, Community Builders, and active community members sharing knowledge and expertise in areas you're interested in.

## Discover Our Hands-On AWS Resources

On the **Build** page, you'll discover ways to get familiar with AWS through hands-on experiences, such as interactive learning resources designed for all skill levels, like AWS Tutorials and AWS Workshops. You can also explore playgrounds for generative AI and agentic AI services, and find the AWS Free Tier to try AWS services for free within specified limits for each service.

Select the **Toolbox** page and discover the latest tools, programming language resources, as well as Open Source projects for AWS. Toolbox has everything you need to bootstrap your project and put it into operation.

To improve the building experience for builders, we plan to expand Builder Center's built-in features, such as creating specialized groups and forums to collaborate on specific topics, organizing workshops for hands-on labs, and building various service playgrounds where builders can freely experiment with AWS services.

## Supporting Your Builder Journey

The new **Learn** section serves as a gateway to skill development, bringing together everything you need to expand your AWS expertise. Here, you can discover learning and training resources, workshops, gamified experiences, and much more content to make your journey building on AWS both educational and engaging.

Select the **Topics** page, where you can explore and discover more content. You can explore content by topic and tags. There are also featured and trending topics sections, helping you stay on top of what's currently attracting community interest.

## Native Localization for Your Spoken Language

AWS Builder Center breaks down language barriers with comprehensive localization support. All content published in Builder Center is automatically available in 16 languages, and user-generated content, such as posts, comments, or wishes, can be machine-translated on demand using AWS Translate service. Thanks to this, you can collaborate with builders around the world, sharing knowledge and experiences across all language boundaries.

By default, all content will be displayed based on the language your browser is set to. However, you can change this setting by accessing the **Settings** page and selecting the language you want AWS Builder Center to use by default.

## Register and Build Your Profile Now

AWS Builder Center gives you a more personalized and comprehensive way to showcase your AWS journey. Your unique profile comes with a custom URL and shareable QR code, making it easy to connect with others and share your presence in the AWS community.

All your posts, wishes, and meaningful interactions are organized in a centralized interface, making them easy to track. On the **Manage profile** page, you can customize your profile, add specific interests and areas of expertise, helping you connect with builders who share your passion. Profile management happens seamlessly: it's synchronized across all AWS services through AWS Builder ID, ensuring your identity is always consistent wherever you engage with AWS services.

Visit **builder.aws.com**, register with AWS Builder ID, and choose your unique alias to access all features, including content creation, Wishlist, and community interaction tools.

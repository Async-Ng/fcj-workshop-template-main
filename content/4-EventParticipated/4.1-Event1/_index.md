### Event Objectives

- Introduce the AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC) model: Reshape how software is developed from planning, development, testing to operation
- Guide how to automate undifferentiated heavy lifting tasks to focus on high-value creative work
- Demonstrate practical application of Amazon Q Developer and Kiro in modern software development

### Speakers

- **Toàn Huỳnh** – Instructor (Presentation on AI-DLC & Amazon Q Developer)
- **Mỹ Nguyễn** – Instructor (Demo of Kiro tool)
- **Location**: AWS Event Hall, Floor 26 Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City

### Key Highlights

#### Evolution: From Code Assistant to AI Agents (2023-2025)

- **2023 (Auto-Complete)**: Support writing code faster
- **2024 (Assistants)**: Create large code blocks, answer technical questions
- **2025 (Agents)**: Complete end-to-end tasks with human-in-the-loop oversight

#### Core Concept: AI-Driven Development (AI-DLC)

Distinguishing development models:

- **AI-Assisted**: AI only supports narrow tasks, humans still do most intellectual work
- **AI-Managed**: AI is fully autonomous (not yet widespread)
- **AI-Driven** (Focus): AI plays the role of orchestrator in the development process, providing plans and architecture. Humans maintain validation role and make final decisions

#### Standard Process: Spec-Driven Development

Standard workflow introduced by speaker Toàn Huỳnh:

- **Inception**: Build User Stories, planning (plan.md), clarify requirements with AI as Product Manager
- **Construction**: AI performs Domain Model creation, code generation, Test and IaC (Infrastructure as Code) writing
- **Operation**: Deployment and incident management

#### Tool Ecosystem: Amazon Q Developer & Kiro

The workshop focuses on demonstrating two main tools:

- **Amazon Q Developer**: AI assistant supporting the entire SDLC lifecycle, helping automate repetitive tasks, code transformation, and application security
- **Kiro**: Agentic AI tool demonstrated by speaker Mỹ Nguyễn, showing capability to execute complex tasks in AI-Driven processes, helping developers reduce manual work

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Common mistakes when working with AI:

- **Single-shot Prompts**: Attempting to solve large/complex problems with only one command
- **Context Overload**: Not refreshing context when conversation is too long, causing AI to "dilute" information
- **Lack of Guidance**: Letting AI make too many decisions without scope control (Over-reach)

### Key Takeaways

#### Design Mindset

- **Reshape software engineers**: Shift thinking from "Code Writer" to "Architect & Validator"
- **Focus on business**: Automation helps developers focus on business logic and creativity instead of repetitive infrastructure configuration

#### Technical Architecture

- **Prompt as Code**: Use standard "Prompt Templates" (e.g., acting as Expert Product Manager) to generate high-quality plans and documents
- **Spec-Driven**: Require clear documentation/planning (like .md files) before coding so AI understands context correctly

#### Modernization Strategy

- Apply **Amazon Q Developer** to handle "undifferentiated heavy lifting" (labor-intensive but low-value work)
- Integrate AI Agents like **Kiro** for higher automation workflows (Agentic Workflows)

#### Application to Work

- **Deploy AI-DLC**: Start applying Inception → Construction process with AI support for upcoming projects
- **Use Amazon Q Developer**: Integrate into IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ) to support code completion, code explanation, and security patching
- **Try Kiro**: Evaluate Kiro's capability in solving specific project problems to increase productivity
- **Optimize Prompts**: Apply plan-first prompt templates to avoid AI generating off-target code or lacking context

### Event Experience

Participating in the AWS GenAI Builder Club session at Bitexco Tower was a very valuable experience:

#### Learning from Experts

- Presenter Toàn Huỳnh's presentation helped me systematize knowledge about AI evolution, from simple auto-complete to complex 2025 Agent models
- Mỹ Nguyễn's real-time Kiro demo was impressive, showing the true potential of AI Agents in handling end-to-end programming tasks

#### Future Vision

- I realized that mastering Amazon Q Developer and tools like Kiro is no longer optional but essential to maintain competitive advantage as a developer in the coming AI era

#### Practical Insights

- Understanding AI-DLC model helps reshape the role of developers from pure coders to architects and validators
- Recognizing the importance of spec-driven development ensures AI has proper context to generate accurate solutions
- Seeing real-world applications of AI agents motivates exploring these tools in actual project work

#### Overall Impact

This event provided valuable insights into the future of software development and reinforced the importance of adapting to AI-augmented workflows for career growth and productivity improvement
